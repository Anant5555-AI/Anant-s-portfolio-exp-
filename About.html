  <p>
    I’m <strong>Anant Anand</strong>, a web development enthusiast currently enrolled at <strong>AlmaBetter</strong>. I love learning about new technologies — understanding the problems they solve and how I can use them to build better, more scalable products.

    Beyond coding, I’m also passionate about health and fitness. As a dedicated <strong>gym enthusiast</strong>, I believe in maintaining a balanced lifestyle both mentally and physically.
